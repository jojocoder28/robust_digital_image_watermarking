Digital watermarking is a crucial technique for embedding and extracting hidden information in digital media, including medical images. Medical image authentication plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity and authenticity of digital medical images, which are essential for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and research. The project focuses on the development of a robust watermarking algorithm for medical image authentication using 3 different methods, including techniques like DWT, SVD, Hamming code. The methods aim to embed an imperceptible watermark into medical images, which can later be extracted to verify the authenticity and integrity of the images.
